# C++ Data Library

> NOTE: this project is still in active development, however it is not currently
ready for production use

# Brief

The main purpose of this library is for processing plain text data formats such
as JSON, CSV and XML although JSON is the only one currently supported. Access
to data and is meant to be simple and flexible so as to cut down on boilerplate.
The Data container itself can also be used for type wrapping as in the case of
cxx-logger (https://github.com/ikehirzel/cxx-logger)

# Current Status

As of right now, the data container itself as well as json parsing are effective
but still need further testing before being used in a production environment.
The projects is currently still in active development

# To Do
